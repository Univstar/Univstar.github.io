<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my PhD in July 2025 from the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, China, where I was supervised by Prof. [Baoquan Chen](https://baoquanchen.info/). As a member of the [Visual Computing and Learning Lab](https://vcl.pku.edu.cn/), I was also advised by Dr. [Bin Wang](https://binwangbfa.github.io/) and Dr. [Mengyu Chu](https://rachelcmy.github.io/). In the area of fluid animation, I was remotely advised by Dr. [Bo Zhu](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~bozhu/) at Georgia Tech, USA. Earlier, I graduated from the Turing Class at Peking University in July 2020, earning dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Physics.

My research focuses on physically-based visual computing, with a specialization in physical simulation. My academic ambition is to comprehend and reproduce kinetics and dynamics of the real world in a virtual counterpart, building theoretical foundations to reveal the physical principles. In the past years, I have extensive experience in the creation of dynamic physical scenes, particularly in multi-physics coupling and developing novel geometric representations for high-fidelity simulation and rendering. Currently, I am exploring innovative methods to bridge physical scene creation and comprehension, and to enhance traditional graphics pipelines with AI.
